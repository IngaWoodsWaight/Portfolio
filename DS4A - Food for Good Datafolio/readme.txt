JANE STREET ENDOWED SCHOLAR
Iâ€™m very honored to be named a Jane Street Endowed Scholar in the DS4A / Empowerment program!

Their selection and sponsorship allowed me to take part in this life-changing program for Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+, veterans, and other underrepresented groups in data!
It matters to me that Jane Street shares a goal to make our future more data-fluent and inclusive.

The DS4A opportunity has given me a platform to learn, meet incredible peers, and advance my career. 
I look forward to what this ecosystem of talented Fellows and corporate partners will accomplish on behalf of underrepresented communities in data!
